# RoboTax

We have developed a simple tool for extrapolating losses in government tax revenue due to non-taxed automation.
Our Proof-of-Concept has been tailored to address the issue of loss of manufacturing jobs across the United States.
  * Simple User Interface 
  * Intuitive algorithm for calculating "owed tax" by automation

## USAGE
  * We see this being utilized by the United States government in order to review proposed laws and regulations
  * We see this being used by corporations in order to more effectively relocate their manufacturing assets based on the expansive tax code 
  * we see this being used by the financial and legal sector in order to more effectively advise their clients (government and private interests)
